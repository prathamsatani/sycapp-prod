You have already created a base sports auction + match management web app.
Now DO NOT rebuild from scratch.
You must refactor, modularize, and enhance the existing app according to the specifications below.

The goal is to create a professional, IPL-style live auction + live match experience with three clearly separated but connected interfaces.

1️⃣ AUTHENTICATION & INTERFACES (CRITICAL)
A. Login System

Implement authentication and role-based access.

There will be 3 roles:

Admin

Display Interface (Public / Audience View)

Registered Users (View-only during auction & matches)

All roles use the same backend but different UI layouts and permissions.

B. Interface Separation

Admin Interface

Full control (auction, teams, matches, approvals, edits)

Display Interface

Large-screen, TV-style UI

Live animations, scorecards, auction flow

User Interface

Same as Display Interface but responsive for mobile/web

View-only (no control actions)

2️⃣ REGISTRATION FLOW (QR + PAYMENT + APPROVAL)
Registration Form Fields

Add the following mandatory fields:

Full Name

Phone Number

Email Address

Player Ratings (existing)

T-Shirt Size (US Sizes)
Options: S, M, L, XL

Photo Upload

Payment Integration (MANUAL VERIFICATION)

Registration Fee: $25

Admin can configure on Admin Home Screen:

Zelle (phone / email / QR)

CashApp (ID / QR)

Venmo (ID / QR)

After Registration (Thank You Screen)

Show 3 clickable payment options:

Zelle

CashApp

Venmo

These must dynamically reflect Admin-configured details.

Admin Approval Workflow

Every new registration goes into Pending State

Admin Dashboard shows:

Player details

Ratings

Payment status

Admin actions:

✅ Admit Player

✏️ Edit Player Ratings (fraud prevention)

❌ Reject if needed

After Admin Admits Player

Automatically:

Send email to the user containing:

Thank you message

Auction Date: 25th January

Tournament Date: 7th February

Display Interface Credentials:

Username: Bhulku

Password: weareone

Activate user visibility everywhere in the system

3️⃣ ADMIN INTERFACE – TEAMS & AUCTION SETUP
Teams

Admin can:

Add teams (minimum 12, expandable to 16)

Set team names

Upload team logos

Auction cannot start unless teams are created

Captains & Vice-Captains

Admin assigns:

Captain

Vice-Captain

These are locked players

Only after this step:

Teams can auction remaining 6 players

4️⃣ AUCTION LOGIC (VERY IMPORTANT)
Player Base Points (Normalization)

DO NOT multiply ratings by 100 anymore.

Normalize players into 4 base categories only:

1500

2000

2500

3000

Category Order (Auction Flow)

Auction must proceed top to bottom:

3000 category

2500 category

2000 category

1500 category

Each category must have fun, Hinglish names
(example tone: funny, desi, cricket-street style — not corporate)

Bidding Rules

Every team starts with 25,000 points max

Cannot exceed this limit

Bid increment rules:

Up to 4000 → +100 increments

Above 4000 → +200 increments

Admin Controls

Start / Pause / Resume Auction

Undo last bid

Undo player sold

Force-sell player

Reassign player if error occurs

Auction Animation (Display Interface)

When a player is sold:

Player card animates visually

Photo moves into the team’s group container

Smooth, celebratory animation (IPL broadcast style)

5️⃣ DISPLAY INTERFACE – LIVE & INTERACTIVE

Design this like Cricbuzz + IPL TV Broadcast:

Teams panel

Squad lists

Player ratings

Auction purse left

Sold / Unsold indicators

Smooth transitions

No static UI. Everything should feel alive.

6️⃣ MATCH DAY SYSTEM
Match Scheduling

Admin Interface:

Select Team A vs Team B

System warns if:

Same teams repeated in same group

Admin can override with warning confirmation

Match Rules

Wide / No-Ball:

Re-ball

+1 run

❌ No Free Hit

Power Over:

Admin selects before each over

All runs in that over are DOUBLED

If wicket falls → –5 runs penalty

Ball-by-Ball Tracking

Store every single ball

Persistent match history

Viewable per match

Animations (Display Interface)

Six → Big animation

Four → Boundary animation

Wicket → Wicket animation

Duck out → Special animation

Power Over active → Visual indicator

7️⃣ ADMIN BROADCAST / RULES PAGE

Admin has a Broadcast Editor

Can write announcements, rules, notices

These appear instantly on:

Display Interface

User Interface

Treated like a live ticker / notice board

8️⃣ UI / UX – IPL-STYLE LOOK (DO NOT JUST SAY “IPL STYLE”)

Design Guidelines:

Bold gradients

Dark backgrounds with neon accents

High-contrast scorecards

Team colors reflected dynamically

Big typography

Stadium / spotlight vibe

Smooth micro-animations

Card-based layouts

TV-broadcast feel, not admin-dashboard feel

No minimalism.
This is cricket entertainment software, not a finance app.

9️⃣ TECHNICAL EXPECTATIONS

Use existing database & models; extend them

Modularize:

Auction Engine

Match Engine

Animation Layer

Ensure real-time updates (WebSockets or equivalent)

Responsive for mobile & large screens

Clean state handling (undo, rollback, resume)

10️⃣ FINAL NOTE (IMPORTANT)

DO NOT MISS ANY FEATURE ABOVE

DO NOT SIMPLIFY LOGIC

DO NOT REMOVE EXISTING WORK

ONLY IMPROVE AND EXTEND

This is a live sports tournament system, not a demo.
